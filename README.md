**📈 TCS Stock Price Prediction**

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the stock price of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) using a combination of data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques.

🔍 Project Overview

Cleaned and processed historical stock data including Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.

Extracted time-based features (day of week, month) and created technical indicators such as moving averages (MA7, MA50) and daily price change.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize trends, volatility, and volume changes.

Implemented Linear Regression to understand feature importance and baseline predictions.

Built an advanced LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to capture sequential patterns in stock prices.

Compared results of ML vs. DL models to evaluate predictive performance.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Train-Test Split)

TensorFlow / Keras (LSTM model for time series forecasting)

Jupyter Notebook (for interactive analysis)

📊 Key Features

✅ Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
✅ Moving Average & Volatility Analysis
✅ Machine Learning (Linear Regression)
✅ Deep Learning (LSTM for sequential prediction)
✅ Visualizations for trends, predictions, and feature importance

📈 Results

Linear Regression provides interpretable predictions but struggles with sudden market fluctuations.

LSTM model achieves better performance by leveraging sequential patterns in stock data.

Demonstrates how combining statistical and deep learning methods can improve financial forecasting.

🚀 Future Improvements

Add more technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands).

Experiment with other models (Random Forest, XGBoost, GRU).

Deploy as a Flask/Django web app with live TCS stock updates.
